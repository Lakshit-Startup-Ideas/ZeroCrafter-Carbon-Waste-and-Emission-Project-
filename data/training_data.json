      "question": "How do I calculate Scope 1 emissions for my manufacturing facility?",
      "answer": "Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources you own or control. To calculate them:\n\n1. **Fuel Combustion**: Track all fuel consumption (diesel, gasoline, natural gas, LPG)\n   - Diesel: 2.68 kg CO2e per liter\n   - Gasoline: 2.31 kg CO2e per liter\n   - Natural Gas: 2.02 kg CO2e per cubic meter\n   - LPG: 2.98 kg CO2e per liter\n\n2. **Refrigerants**: Track refrigerant leaks and disposal\n   - R134a: 1,430 kg CO2e per kg\n   - R404a: 3,922 kg CO2e per kg\n\n3. **Formula**: Scope 1 = (Fuel Consumption × Emission Factor) + (Refrigerant Leaks × GWP)\n\nExample: 1000 liters diesel = 1000 × 2.68 = 2,680 kg CO2e",
